# Mechanical System Simulation using Forward Kinematics

## Overview

This Python program implements a mechanical system simulation using forward kinematics. The primary purpose of this program is to calculate the end point of a mechanical system given the angles α and β that completely define the system in a two-dimensional space. Additionally, it allows you to specify the desired end point, and the program calculates the corresponding angles required to achieve that position.

## How to do it?

Implement a forward kinematics function that receives the angles that fully define the system and calculates the distance of the end point to the desired point. After this, you just have to tell the optimizer to minimize the distance and you're done
